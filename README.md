Hello! This acc. is a WIP, but thanks for stopping by! If you're here, you must have met us on PT. Cool!

CHECK GITHUB NAME FOR WHO'S FRONTING

PT INFO:
Please respect whatever tags we have in our pony's name! We usually use W2I (whisper to interact-we usually have public chat off, so even if we're online, we won't see your message!), IWC (interact with caution) or DNI (do not interact-usually we have this one if we're busy). Sometimes you might see CD/TD/DNT. We're aware these are controversial! However, please do not make some snarky comment about it if we're using it. If we're open to C+H we'll have it in our name! Do not C+H otherwise. 

BYF/INT:
We are an endogenic system with an unknown source. We sometimes have switching amnesia! Please be patient and respectful. DNI if you think endogenic systems are "fake". [https://www.reddit.com/r/plural/comments/vjdn5j/are(_endogenic_systems_real/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button] DNI if: under 14 • racist • homophobic • transphobic • fakeclaimer (we will NEVER try to "diagnose/invalidate" you. Just be honest with yourself!) • antifurry/therian • are part of ANY hate communities (even hate towards haters!) • are a trump supporter • agere/petre NSFW (or any NSFW actually) • This is NOT an exhaustive list. Just don't be a jerk!

Anyways, sorry for the long DNI list :'] Here's some fandom INTs!:

DSMP/OSMP/QSMP (we do NOT support the irl members! DNI if you do!) • Cartoon Network • Bluey • SF • Omori • UT/DR • COTL • FNAF • COD • Fantastic Mr. Fox (please!!!) • WOF • WC • Again, not an exhaustive list. We don't do similar video game INTs besides ones listed. Also, DNI if you're toxic in any way about/with any of these. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE IN ANY OF THESE FANDOMS IN ORDER TO INTERACT WITH US!!!

This is still a WIP but that's it for now :] Thanks for being here!
